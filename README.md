DualGrid Demo use 2 x CLASS TGrid(), based on Listview (SysListView32)

Like Windows Explorer you can switch View Style and use SHFileOperation() to copy,move, rename or delete File(s)

DualGrid Demo have different Style e.g. use Checkbox (Device iPhone) or use “virtual” Grid (More Property)
which can handle Array Data “on-fly” up to 100.000.000 Elements

You can add new TAB ( TFolder ) on each TGrid() using n-Dim Array with #xtranslate

Between both TGrid is a SPLITTER

Right-click on TGrid() will open Popup Menu

You can use Darkmode (see Color Menu)

Can attach Device which have no Drive Letter like iPhone to Download Photo

“safe” Eject USB Device

CONFIG.INI (save only 1st TAB of each TGrid() )
